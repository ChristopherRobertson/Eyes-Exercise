# Eye Movement Exercise

## Description
In this exercise divs are created on the screen that track the mouse movement that mimics the momement of two eyes. 

## Useage

Clone the repository to your local machine then load the index.html file into the broswer. Move the mouse around to watch the pupils of the eyes track the mouse around the browser

## Roadmap

I would like to add more to this project by creating some sort of face to go with the eyes, maybe something like a Jack-O-Lantern for Halloween.
